  abstract =      {In traditional physicochemical modeling, one derives
                   evolution equations at the (macroscopic, coarse)
                   scale of interest; these are used to perform a
                   variety of tasks (simulation, bifurcation analysis,
                   optimization) using an arsenal of analytical and
                   numerical techniques. For many complex systems,
                   however, although one observes evolution at a
                   macroscopic scale of interest, accurate models are
                   only given at a more detailed (fine-scale,
                   microscopic) level of description (e.g., lattice
                   Boltzmann, kinetic Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics).
                   Here, we review a framework for computer-aided
                   multiscale analysis, which enables macroscopic
                   computational tasks (over extended spatiotemporal
                   scales) using only appropriately initialized
                   microscopic simulation on short time and length
                   scales. The methodology bypasses the derivation of
                   macroscopic evolution equations when these equations
                   conceptually exist but are not available in closed
                   form---hence the term equation-free. We selectively
                   discuss basic algorithms and underlying principles
                   and illustrate the approach through representative
                   applications. We also discuss potential difficulties
                   and outline areas for future research.},

  abstract =      {Developments in dynamical systems theory provides new
                   support for the macroscale modelling of \pde{}s and
                   other microscale systems such as Lattice Boltzmann,
                   Monte Carlo or Molecular Dynamics simulators. By
                   systematically resolving subgrid microscale dynamics
                   the dynamical systems approach constructs accurate
                   closures of macroscale discretisations of the
                   microscale system. Here we specifically explore
                   reaction-diffusion problems in two spatial dimensions
                   as a prototype of generic systems in multiple
                   dimensions. Our approach unifies into one the
                   modelling of systems by a type of finite elements,
                   and the `equation free' macroscale modelling of
                   microscale simulators efficiently executing only on
                   small patches of the spatial domain. Centre manifold
                   theory ensures that a closed model exist on the
                   macroscale grid, is emergent, and is systematically
                   approximated. Dividing space either into overlapping
                   finite elements or into spatially separated small
                   patches, the specially crafted inter-element/patch
                   coupling also ensures that the constructed
                   discretisations are consistent with the microscale
                   system\slash\pde\ to as high an order as desired.
                   Computer algebra handles the considerable algebraic
                   details as seen in the specific application to the
                   Ginzburg--Landau \pde. However, higher order models
                   in multiple dimensions require a mixed numerical and
                   algebraic approach that is also developed. The
                   modelling here may be straightforwardly adapted to a
                   wide class of reaction-diffusion \pde{}s and lattice
                   equations in multiple space dimensions. When applied
                   to patches of microscopic simulations our coupling
                   conditions promise efficient macroscale simulation.},

  abstract =      {We are developing a framework for multiscale
                   computation which enables models at a ``microscopic''
                   level of description, for example, lattice Boltzmann,
                   Monte Carlo, or molecular dynamics simulators, to
                   perform modeling tasks at ``macroscopic'' length
                   scales of interest. The plan is to use the
                   microscopic rules restricted to small ``patches'' of
                   the domain, the ``teeth,'' using interpolation to
                   bridge the ``gaps.'' Here we explore general boundary
                   conditions coupling the widely separated ``teeth'' of
                   the microscopic simulation that achieve high order
                   accuracy over the macroscale. We present the simplest
                   case when the microscopic simulator is the
                   quintessential example of a PDE. We argue that
                   classic high order interpolation of the macroscopic
                   field provides the correct forcing in whatever
                   boundary condition is required by the microsimulator.
                   Such interpolation leads to tooth boundary
                   conditions, which achieve arbitrarily high order
                   consistency. The high order consistency is
                   demonstrated on a class of linear PDEs in two ways:
                   first through the eigenvalues of the scheme for
                   selected numerical problems, and second using the
                   dynamical systems approach of holistic discretization
                   on a general class of linear PDEs. Analytic modeling
                   shows that, for a wide class of microscopic systems,
                   the subgrid fields and the effective macroscopic
                   model are largely independent of the tooth size and
                   the particular tooth boundary conditions. When
                   applied to patches of microscopic simulations these
                   tooth boundary conditions promise efficient
                   macroscale simulation. We expect the same approach
                   will also accurately couple patch simulations in
                   higher spatial dimensions.},

                   The `equation-free' methodology couples many small
                   patches of microscale computations across space to
                   empower efficient computational simulation over
                   macroscale domains of interest. Motivated by
                   molecular or agent simulations, we analyse the
                   performance of various coupling schemes for patches
                   when the microscale is inherently `rough'. As a
                   canonical problem in this universality class, we
                   systematically analyse the case of heterogeneous
                   diffusion on a lattice. Computer algebra explores how
                   the dynamics of coupled patches predict the large
                   scale emergent macroscale dynamics of the
                   computational scheme. We determine good design for
                   the coupling of patches by comparing the macroscale
                   predictions from patch dynamics with the emergent
                   macroscale on the entire domain, thus minimising the
                   computational error of the multiscale modelling. The
                   minimal error on the macroscale is obtained when the
                   coupling utilises averaging regions which are between
                   a third and a half of the patch. Moreover, when the
                   symmetry of the inter-patch coupling matches that of
                   the underlying microscale structure, patch dynamics
                   predicts the desired macroscale dynamics to any
                   specified order of error. The results confirm that
                   the patch scheme is useful for macroscale
                   computational simulation of a range of systems with
                   microscale heterogeneity.},

                   equation-free method in the setting of slow-fast
                   systems. First, we give a rigorous convergence result
                   for equation-free analysis showing that the
                   implicitly defined coarse-level time stepper
                   converges to the true dynamics on the slow manifold
                   within an error that is exponentially small with
                   respect to the small parameter measuring time scale
                   separation. Second, we apply this result to the
                   idealized traffic modeling problem of phantom jams
                   generated by cars with uniform behavior on a circular
                   road. The traffic jams are waves that travel slowly
                   against the direction of traffic. Equation-free
                   analysis enables us to investigate the behavior of
                   the microscopic traffic model on a macroscopic level.
                   The standard deviation of cars' headways is chosen as
                   the macroscopic measure of the underlying dynamics
                   such that traveling wave solutions correspond to
                   equilibria on the macroscopic level in the
                   equation-free setup. The collapse of the traffic jam
                   to the free flow then corresponds to a saddle-node
                   bifurcation of this macroscopic equilibrium. We
                   continue this bifurcation in two parameters using
                   equation-free analysis.},

  abstract =      {A common approach to studying high-dimensional
                   systems with emergent low-dimensional behavior is
                   based on lift-evolve-restrict maps (called
                   equation-free methods): first, a user-defined lifting
                   operator maps a set of low-dimensional coordinates
                   into the high-dimensional phase space, then the
                   high-dimensional (microscopic) evolution is applied
                   for some time, and finally a user-defined restriction
                   operator maps down into a low-dimensional space
                   again. We prove convergence of equation-free methods
                   for finite time scale separation with respect to a
                   method parameter, the so-called healing time. Our
                   convergence result justifies equation-free methods as
                   a tool for performing high-level tasks such as
                   bifurcation analysis on high-dimensional systems.
                   More precisely, if the high-dimensional system has an
                   attracting invariant manifold with smaller expansion
                   and attraction rates in the tangential direction than
                   in the transversal direction (normal hyperbolicity),
                   and restriction and lifting satisfy some generic
                   transversality conditions, then an implicit
                   formulation of the lift-evolve-restrict procedure
                   generates an approximate map that converges to the
                   flow on the invariant manifold for healing time going
                   to infinity. In contrast to all previous results, our
                   result does not require the time scale separation to
                   be large. A demonstration with Michaelis--Menten
                   kinetics shows that the error estimates of our
                   theorem are sharp. The ability to achieve convergence
                   even for finite time scale separation is especially
                   important for applications involving stochastic
                   systems, where the evolution occurs at the level of
                   distributions, governed by the Fokker--Planck
                   equation. In these applications the spectral gap is
                   typically finite. We investigate a low-dimensional
                   stochastic differential equation where the ratio
                   between the decay rates of fast and slow variables is
                   2.},

                   attracting, invariant ``slow manifold '' that can be
                   parameterized by a few observable variables. We
                   present a procedure that, given a process for
                   integrating the system step by step and a set of
                   values of the observables, finds the values of the
                   remaining system variables such that the state is
                   close to the slow manifold to some desired accuracy.
                   It should be noted that this is not equivalent to
                   ``integrating down to the manifold '' since the
                   latter process may significantly change the values of
                   the observables. We consider problems whose solution
                   has a singular perturbation expansion, although we do
                   not know what it is nor have any way to compute it
                   (because the system is not necessarily expressed in a
                   singular perturbation form). We show in this paper
                   that, under some conditions, computing the values of
                   the remaining variables so that their (m + 1)st time
                   derivatives are zero provides an estimate of the
                   unknown variables that is an mth-order approximation
                   to a point on the slow manifold in a sense to be
                   defined. We then show how this criterion can be
                   applied approximately when the system is defined by a
                   legacy code rather than directly through closed form
                   equations. This procedure can be valuable when one
                   wishes to start a simulation of the detailed model on
                   the slow manifold with particular values of
                   observable variables characterizing the slow

                   The gap-tooth scheme is designed to approximate a

                   in a macroscopic domain; it uses appropriately
                   initialized simulations of the available microscopic

                   the boxes. We illustrate this theoretical result with
                   numerical tests on several model problems. We also

                   individual-based/agent-based modeling has been
                   applied to study a wide range of applications,
                   ranging from engineering problems to phenomena in
                   sociology, economics and biology. Simulating such
                   agent-based models over extended spatiotemporal
                   domains can be prohibitively expensive due to
                   stochasticity and the presence of multiple scales.
                   Nevertheless, many agent-based problems exhibit
                   smooth behavior in space and time on a macroscopic
                   scale, suggesting that a useful coarse-grained
                   continuum model could be obtained. For such problems,
                   the equation-free framework [16--18] can
                   significantly reduce the computational cost. Patch
                   dynamics is an essential component of this framework.
                   This scheme is designed to perform numerical
                   simulations of an unavailable macroscopic equation on
                   macroscopic time and length scales; it uses
                   appropriately initialized simulations of the
                   fine-scale agent-based model in a number of small
                   ``patches'', which cover only a fraction of the
                   spatiotemporal domain. In this work, we construct a
                   finite-volume-inspired conservative patch dynamics
                   scheme and apply it to a financial market agent-based
                   model based on the work of Omurtag and Sirovich [22].
                   We first apply our patch dynamics scheme to a
                   continuum approximation of the agent-based model, to
                   study its performance and analyze its accuracy. We
                   then apply the scheme to the agent-based model
                   itself. Our computational experiments indicate that
                   here, typically, the patch dynamics-based simulation
                   needs to be performed in only 20% of the full agent
                   simulation space, and in only 10% of the temporal
                   domain.},

                   reduce the expensive numerical simulations of
                   complicated waves over large spatial domains. The
                   multiscale model is built from given microscale
                   simulations of complicated physical processes such as
                   sea ice or turbulent shallow water. Our long term aim
                   is to enable macroscale simulations obtained by
                   coupling small patches of simulations together over
                   large physical distances. This initial work explores
                   the coupling of patch simulations of wave-like pdes.
                   With the line of development being to water waves we
                   discuss the dynamics of two complementary fields
                   called the `depth' h and `velocity' u. A staggered
                   grid is used for the microscale simulation of the
                   depth h and velocity u. We introduce a macroscale
                   staggered grid to couple the microscale patches.
                   Linear or quadratic interpolation provides boundary
                   conditions on the field in each patch. Linear
                   analysis of the whole coupled multiscale system
                   establishes that the resultant macroscale dynamics is
                   appropriate. Numerical simulations support the linear
                   analysis. This multiscale method should empower the

                   develops a model of the longitudinal transport of
                   suspended sediment in environmental fluid flows such
                   as floods and tsunamis. The model is systematically
                   derived from a three-dimensional turbulence model
                   based on the Smagorinski large eddy closure.
                   Embedding the physical dynamics into a family of
                   problems and analysing the linear dynamics of the
                   system, the centre manifold theory indicates the
                   existence of a slow manifold parameterised by
                   macroscale variables. Computer algebra then
                   constructs the slow manifold in terms of fluid depth,
                   depth-averaged longitudinal velocities, and suspended
                   sediment concentration. The model includes the
                   effects of sediment erosion, advection and dispersion
                   and the interactions between the sediment and
                   turbulent fluid flow. Vertical distributions of the
                   velocity and concentration in steady flow agree with
                   established experimental data. For a pilot study,
                   numerical simulations of the suspended sediment under
                   long waves show that the developed model predicts
                   physically reasonable sediment flow interaction.},

                   data transfer speeds have failed to keep pace and are
                   the major limiting factor in the development of
                   exascale computing. New algorithms must be developed
                   which minimise the transfer of data. Patch dynamics
                   is a computational macroscale modelling scheme which
                   provides a coarse macroscale solution of a problem
                   defined on a fine microscale by dividing the domain
                   into many nonoverlapping, coupled patches. Patch
                   dynamics is readily adaptable to massive
                   parallelisation as each processor can evaluate the
                   dynamics on one, or a few, patches. However, patch
                   coupling conditions interpolate across the
                   unevaluated parts of the domain between patches, and
                   are typically reevaluated at every microscale time

                   We propose a modified patch dynamics scheme which
                   minimises data transfer by only reevaluating the
                   patch coupling conditions at `mesoscale' time scales
                   which are significantly larger than the microscale

  abstract =      {Throw some dye into a flowing river; how is the dye
                   going to disperse along the river? The dynamics may
                   be modelled by Taylor's one-dimensional model of
                   shear dispersion. We discuss the creation and utility
                   of models of the dispersion of the dye, using
                   invariant manifold theory. The models are effective
                   exponentially quickly. We describe a one-mode centre
                   manifold and a two-mode and a three-mode invariant
                   manifold model. From the analysis, we decide under
                   what conditions these three models are valid. Using
                   the geometric picture provided by the theory of
                   invariant manifolds, we find a complete set of
                   initial conditions for the models so that the
                   evolution of the full and approximate systems are
                   identical after a short time. Throughout, a
                   comparison of the three models is made to identify
                   the practical situations when each model will be
                   preferred.},

  title =         {Long-scale evolution of thin liquid films},
  volume =        {69},
  year =          {1997},
  abstract =      {Macroscopic thin liquid films are entities that are
                   important in biophysics, physics, and engineering, as
                   well as in natural settings. They can be composed of
                   common liquids such as water or oil, rheologically
                   complex materials such as polymers solutions or
                   melts, or complex mixtures of phases or components.
                   When the films are subjected to the action of various
                   mechanical, thermal, or structural factors, they
                   display interesting dynamic phenomena such as wave
                   propagation, wave steepening, and development of
                   chaotic responses. Such films can display rupture
                   phenomena creating holes, spreading of fronts, and
                   the development of fingers. In this review a unified
                   mathematical theory is presented that takes advantage
                   of the disparity of the length scales and is based on
                   the asymptotic procedure of reduction of the full set
                   of governing equations and boundary conditions to a
                   simplified, highly nonlinear, evolution equation or
                   to a set of equations. As a result of this long-wave
                   theory, a mathematical system is obtained that does
                   not have the mathematical complexity of the original
                   free-boundary problem but does preserve many of the
                   important features of its physics. The basics of the
                   long-wave theory are explained. If, in addition, the
                   Reynolds number of the flow is not too large, the
                   analogy with Reynolds's theory of lubrication can be
                   drawn. A general nonlinear evolution equation or
                   equations are then derived and various particular
                   cases are considered. Each case contains a discussion
                   of the linear stability properties of the base-state
                   solutions and of the nonlinear spatiotemporal
                   evolution of the interface (and other scalar
                   variables, such as temperature or solute
                   concentration). The cases reducing to a single highly
                   nonlinear evolution equation are first examined.
                   These include: (a) films with constant interfacial
                   shear stress and constant surface tension, (b) films
                   with constant surface tension and gravity only, (c)
                   films with van der Waals (long-range molecular)
                   forces and constant surface tension only, (d) films
                   with thermocapillarity, surface tension, and body
                   force only, (e) films with temperature-dependent
                   physical properties, (f) evaporating/condensing
                   films, (g) films on a thick substrate, (h) films on a
                   horizontal cylinder, and (i) films on a rotating
                   disc. The dynamics of the films with a spatial
                   dependence of the base-state solution are then
                   studied. These include the examples of nonuniform
                   temperature or heat flux at liquid-solid boundaries.
                   Problems which reduce to a set of nonlinear evolution
                   equations are considered next. Those include (a) the
                   dynamics of free liquid films, (b) bounded films with
                   interfacial viscosity, and (c) dynamics of soluble
                   and insoluble surfactants in bounded and free films.
                   The spreading of drops on a solid surface and moving
                   contact lines, including effects of heat and mass
                   transport and van der Waals attractions, are then
                   addressed. Several related topics such as falling
                   films and sheets and Hele-Shaw flows are also briefly
                   discussed. The results discussed give motivation for
                   the development of careful experiments which can be
                   used to test the theories and exhibit new phenomena.},

  year =          {2018},
  abstract =      {Many physical systems are formulated on domains which
                   are relatively large in some directions but
                   relatively thin in other directions. We expect such
                   systems to have emergent structures that vary slowly
                   over the large dimensions. Common mathematical
                   approximations for determining the emergent dynamics
                   often rely on self-consistency arguments or limits as
                   the aspect ratio of the `large' and `thin' dimensions
                   becomes nonphysically infinite. Here we extend to
                   nonlinear dynamics a new approach [IMA J. Appl.
                   Maths, DOI: 10.1093/imamat/hxx021] which analyses the
                   dynamics at each cross-section of the domain via a
                   rigorous multivariate Taylor series. Then centre
                   manifold theory supports the global modelling of the
                   system's emergent dynamics in the large but finite
                   domain. Interactions between the cross-section
                   coupling and both fast and slow dynamics determines
                   quantitative error bounds for the nonlinear
                   modelling. We illustrate the methodology by deriving
                   the large-scale dynamics of a thin liquid film, where
                   the film is subject to a Coriolis force induced by a
                   rotating substrate. The approach developed here
                   quantifies the accuracy of known approximations,
                   extends such approximations to mixed order modelling,
                   and may open previously intractable modelling issues
                   to new tools and insights.},

  abstract =      {Extracting coarse-grained derivative information from
                   fine scale, atomistic/stochastic simulations
                   constitutes an important component of multiscale
                   numerics for reacting systems. In this paper, we
                   demonstrate the use of local parametric diffusion
                   models; observing the output of short bursts of
                   stochastic simulation, the drift and diffusion
                   coefficients of such local models are obtained ``on
                   demand'' by maximizing an approximation of the
                   likelihood function. The parametric fit utilizes the
                   likelihood expansion of Ait-Sahalia, giving
                   closed-form expressions for the transition density of
                   both scalar and multivariate processes. The fine
                   scale simulations generating the data are the
                   Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm as well as
                   stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The
                   postulated local parametric diffusion models are SDEs
                   with affine drift and diffusion functions; the
                   information extracted from these (estimated) local
                   parametric models is utilized in various
                   ``equation-free'' computational tasks. We demonstrate
                   how such local diffusion modeling can (1) contribute
                   to linking stochastic simulation with traditional,
                   continuum numerical methods such as fixed point and
                   initial value problem solving algorithms as well as
                   variational integration; (2) aid in extracting
                   quantitative information about the invariant
                   distribution associated with the underlying
                   stochastic system; and (3) be used in computational
                   model reduction motivated by singular perturbation
                   theory.},
