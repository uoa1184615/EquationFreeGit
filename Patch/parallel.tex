Get familiar with the patch scheme of \cref{sec:patch}.

For large-scale simulations, we here assume you have a compute cluster with many independent computer processors linked by a high-speed network.
The aim is to distribute computations in parallel across the cluster.
\Matlab's Parallel Computing Toolbox empowers a reasonably straightforward way to implement this.

The patch scheme has a clear domain decomposition of assigning a few patches to each processor.
