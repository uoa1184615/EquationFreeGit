\section{Introduction}


Consider spatio-temporal multiscale systems where the
spatial domain is so large that a given microscale code
cannot be computed in a reasonable time.  The \emph{patch
scheme} computes the microscale details only on small
patches of the space-time domain, and produce correct
macroscale predictions by craftily coupling the patches
across unsimulated space \cite[e.g.]{Hyman2005, Samaey03b,
Samaey04, Roberts06d, Liu2015}.  The resulting macroscale
predictions were generally proved to be consistent with the
microscale dynamics, to some specified order of accuracy, in
a series of papers: 1D-space dissipative systems
\cite[]{Roberts06d, Bunder2013b}; 2D-space dissipative
systems \cite[]{Roberts2011a, Bunder2020a}; and 1D-space
wave-like systems \cite[]{Cao2014a}.

The microscale spatial structure is to be on a lattice such
as obtained from finite difference\slash element\slash
volume approximation of a \pde. The microscale is either
continuous or discrete in time.

\paragraph{Quick start}
See \cref{sec:configPatches1eg,sec:configPatches2eg} which
respectively list example basic code that uses the provided 
functions to simulate the 1D Burgers'~\pde, and a 2D 
nonlinear `diffusion'~\pde.  Then see \cref{fig:constructpatch}.

microsimulators whether coded from \textsc{pde}s, lattice
systems, or agent\slash particle microscale simulators. The
patch functions require that a user configure the patches,
and interface the coupled patches with a time
integrator\slash simulator. This chart overviews the main

    \node [block] (configPatches) {\textbf{Setup problem and construct patches}
    
    Invoke \texttt{configpatches1} (for 1D) or \texttt{configpatches2} (for 2D) or \texttt{configpatches3} (for 3D) to setup the microscale problem (\textsc{pde}, domain, boundary conditions, etc) and the desired patch structure (number of patches, patch size, coupling order, etc).
These initialise the global struct \texttt{patches} that contains information required to simulate the microscale dynamics within each patch. 
If necessary, define additional components for the struct \texttt{patches} (e.g., see \texttt{homogenisationExample.m}).};

    \node [block, below=of configPatches] (microPDE) {\textbf{Simulate the multiscale system}
    
    Generally invoke a \textsc{pde} integrator to simulate the multiscale system of a user's microscale code within spatially separated patches. This integrator may be \script\ defined (e.g., \texttt{ode23\slash ode45}) or user defined (e.g., a projective integrator).
    
    Input to the integrator is the function \texttt{patchSmooth1} (for 1D) or \texttt{patchSmooth2} (for 2D) or \texttt{patchSmooth3} (for 3D) which  interfaces to the microscale's code. Other inputs are the macro-time span and initial conditions. Output from the integrator is the solution field over the given time span, but only within the defined patches.};
    
    \node [smallblock, above right=-3\WD and 2\WD of microPDE] (patchSmooth1) {\textbf{Interface to microscale}
    
    \texttt{patchSmooth1\slash2\slash3} interfaces with the microscale \textsc{pde}\slash lattice system and invokes the patch coupling conditions. Input is the field in every patch at one time-step, and output is time-derivatives of the field, or values at the next time-step, as appropriate.};
    
    \node [tinyblock, below left=4ex and -3\WD of patchSmooth1] (coupling) {\textbf{Coupling conditions}
    
    \texttt{patchEdgeInt1\slash2\slash3} (for 1D, 2D, or 3D respectively) couple patches together by setting edge-values via macroscale interpolation of order in global \texttt{patches.ordCC}.};
    \node [tinyblock, below right=4ex and -3\WD of patchSmooth1] (micropde) {\textbf{Microscale system}
    
    A user's microscale code, pointed to by \texttt{patches.fun}, codes the microscale dynamics on the interior of the patch microgrids, \texttt{patches.x}, to compute either a micro-step or time-derivatives.

\section{To do}
\begin{itemize}
\item Some users will have microscale that has a fixed
microscale lattice spacing, in which case we should code the
scale ratio~\(r\) to follow from the choice of the number of
lattice points in a patch.
\item Core averages code.
%\item Heterogeneous microscale via averaging regions---but
%I suspect should be separated from simple homogenisation
\item Parallel processing versions.  Matlab makes it easy with \verb|distributed|, \verb|codistributed|, et al.
\item Adapt to maps in micro-time?  Surely easy, just an example.
\end{itemize}
