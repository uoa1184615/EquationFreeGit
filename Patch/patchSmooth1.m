%\subsection{Introduction}

To simulate in time with spatial patches we often need to
interface a user's time derivative function with time
integration routines such as \verb|ode15s| or~\verb|PIRK2|.
This function provides an interface. It mostly assumes that
the sub-patch structure is \emph{smooth} so that the patch
centre-values are sensible macroscale variables, and patch
edge values are determined by macroscale interpolation of
the patch-centre values.  However, we have found that
microscale heterogeneous systems may be accurately simulated
with this function via appropriate interpolation.
Communicate patch-design variables to this function using
the previously established global struct~\verb|patches|
(\cref{sec:configPatches1}).
\begin{matlab}
%}
function dudt=patchSmooth1(t,u)
global patches
%{
\end{matlab}

\paragraph{Input}
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|u| is a vector of length \(\verb|nSubP|\cdot
\verb|nPatch|\cdot \verb|nVars|\) where there are
\verb|nVars| field values at each of the points in the
\(\verb|nSubP|\times \verb|nPatch|\) grid.

\item \verb|t| is the current time to be passed to the
user's time derivative function.

\item \verb|patches| a struct set by \verb|configPatches1()|
with the following information  used here.
\begin{itemize}

\item \verb|.fun| is the name of the user's function
\verb|fun(t,u,x)| that computes the time derivatives on the
patchy lattice. The array~\verb|u| has size
\(\verb|nSubP|\times \verb|nPatch|\times \verb|nVars|\).
Time derivatives must be computed into the same sized array,
although herein the patch edge values are overwritten by zeros.

\item \verb|.x| is \(\verb|nSubP|\times \verb|nPatch|\)
array of the spatial locations~\(x_{ij}\) of the microscale
grid points in every patch. Currently it \emph{must} be an
equi-spaced lattice on both macro- and microscales.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Output}
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|dudt| is \(\verb|nSubP|\cdot \verb|nPatch|\cdot
\verb|nVars|\) vector of time derivatives, but with patch
edge values set to zero.
\end{itemize}




\begin{devMan}
Reshape the fields~\verb|u| as a 2/3D-array, and sets the
edge values from macroscale interpolation of centre-patch
values. \cref{sec:patchEdgeInt1} describes
\verb|patchEdgeInt1()|.
\begin{matlab}
%}
u=patchEdgeInt1(u);
%{
\end{matlab}

Ask the user function for the time derivatives computed in
the array, overwrite its edge values with the dummy value of
zero, then return to a to the user\slash integrator as
column vector.
\begin{matlab}
%}
dudt=patches.fun(t,u,patches.x);
dudt([1 end],:,:,:)=0;
dudt=reshape(dudt,[],1);
%{
\end{matlab}
Fin.
\end{devMan}
