folder in a path searched by Matlab/Octave. 

<p>This <em>equation-free toolbox</em> empowers the
computer-assisted analysis of complex, multiscale systems.
Its aim is to enable you to use microscopic simulators to
perform system level tasks and analysis, because microscale
simulations are often the best available description of a
system. The methodology bypasses the derivation of
macroscopic evolution equations by computing only short
bursts of of the microscale simulator, and often only
computing on small patches of the spatial domain. This suite
of functions empowers users to start implementing such
methods in their own applications. The document
<tt>eqnFreeUserMan-newest.pdf</tt> describes how to use the
main functions of interest to you.

<p><b>Contributors:</b> This project aims to collectively develop a
Matlab/Octave toolbox of <em>equation-free</em> algorithms.
Initially the algorithms are to be straightforward.  The
plan is to subsequently develop more and more capability.
<tt>Doc/eqnFreeDevMan.pdf</tt> fully details the function code and
many examples.  The Appendix outlines how to contribute to
the project.

<p>Paul Petersik is also developing some equation-free
projective integration, but in python, see
