<p><b>Contributors:</b> This project aims to collectively develop a
Matlab/Octave toolbox of <em>equation-free</em> algorithms.
Initially the algorithms are to be straightforward.  The
plan is to subsequently develop more and more capability.
<tt>Doc/eqnFreeDevMan.pdf</tt> fully details the function code and
many examples.  The Appendix outlines how to contribute to
the project.

<p>Paul Petersik is also developing some equation-free
projective integration, but in python, see
