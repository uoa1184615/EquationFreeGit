Equation-Free function toolbox for Matlab/Octave
================================================

Users: Place this toolbox's folder in a path searched by
Matlab/Octave.  The document `eqnFreeUserMan-newest.pdf`
describes how to use the main functions of interest to you.

Contributors: This project aims to collectively develop a
Matlab/Octave toolbox of *equation-free* algorithms.
Initially the algorithms are to be straightforward.  The
plan is to subsequently develop more and more capability.
`Doc/eqnFreeDevMan.pdf` fully details the function code and
many examples.  The Appendix outlines how to contribute to
the project.

Paul Petersik is also developing some equation-free
projective integration, but in python, see
