\def\dmd{\textsc{dmd}}

This is a very first stab at a good projective integration function that uses \dmd.

\paragraph{To do}
\begin{itemize}
\item Try examples like the modulated oscillations of 2302.09341.pdf

\item Check the order of accuracy of the algorithm.
\item Develop theory quantitively justifying the \dmd\ approach.
\item Develop techniques to automatically make some of the decisions about step-sizes, burst lengths, rank, and so on.
\item Develop higher accuracy versions (once we have some idea about current accuracy).
\item Adapt approach to algorithms for stochastic systems.
\end{itemize}
